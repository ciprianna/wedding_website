  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Tyler and Ciprianna met in late summer of 2010, while they were both attending a school trip in Washington, D.C. The two sat next to each other at a restaurant in Old Town, Alexandria. Ciprianna had never tried sushi before, so Tyler ordered a plate to share. They became friends from that point on, and kept in touch after the trip was over.  Tyler and Ciprianna started dating on September 24th, 2010 and the rest is history.</p>

  <h2>The Big Question</h2>
  <p>After nearly five years of friendship and love, Ciprianna came home from work one day to find a vase full of beautiful flowers on the counter. Alongside the flowers was a letter from Tyler, telling her to go to the small lake outside of their apartment.  Ciprianna walked to the lake and saw him nervously waiting. As their song played, Tyler asked Ciprianna to spend the rest of their lives together!</p>
